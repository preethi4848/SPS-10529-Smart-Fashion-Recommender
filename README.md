# Smart Fashion Recommender
Smart Fashion Recommender is an e-commerce website project that I developed :girl:. The backend was written by Flask (Python) and the frontend used Bootstrap. In addition to an easy-to-use and robust web interface, I also integrated some AI technologies :robot: to make the project unique. For example, there is a recommendation system to provide useful feedback on what a user might potentially want to buy, based on their previous choices. A chatbot is also available to provide a sense of personalized shopping and seamless service. I plan to implement even more interesting features as future work. Scalable and adaptive, this website can be used by a wide range of e-commerce businesses. Please give me :star: if you find it useful.
